# Prompt:
I am looking to design a material with a formation energy per atom of -3.8 eV/atom.
Your objective is to propose a new material composition that achieves the desired property by exploring the materials space across the periodic table.
In the previous step, you suggested the composition LaEuPd6, and got the following feedback:
The formation energy per atom of material generated from the composition was -0.866 eV/atom.

In this step, you refer to an external database to understand how materials properties change when substituting one material to another.
Below is the information on how property values change with composition for several materials, which might be useful.

* When the composition LaEuPd6 changes to the composition Y(VFe5)2, the property value of the corresponding material changes from -0.656 eV/atom to -0.070 eV/atom.
 This is likely because of the following reasons: The substantial difference in formation energy between LaEuPd6 and Y(VFe5)2 can be attributed to several factors. LaEuPd6, containing heavy and electronegative elements like Pd, likely exhibits strong metallic bonding, reducing energy per atom significantly. In contrast, Y(VFe5)2, with transition metals V and Fe, may have more complex magnetic interactions and less efficient packing, thus higher energy. Differences in bonding types, lattice stability, and element electronegativity heavily influence these energies.

* When the composition La3SiPd5 changes to the composition Ca2CoN2, the property value of the corresponding material changes from -0.904 eV/atom to -0.786 eV/atom.
 This is likely because of the following reasons: The formation energy difference arises from variations in elemental properties, such as electronegativity and atomic size, between La3SiPd5 and Ca2CoN2. La, Si, and Pd form stronger metallic and covalent bonds compared to Ca, Co, and N, due to higher cohesive energy and bond strengths. Crystal structure and degree of ionic versus covalent nature also play a role, with Ca2CoN2 having contributions from ionic interactions that result in less negative formation energy.

* When the composition EuGePd2 changes to the composition Eu2TaAlO6, the property value of the corresponding material changes from -0.767 eV/atom to -3.443 eV/atom.
 This is likely because of the following reasons: The formation energy per atom difference between EuGePd2 and Eu2TaAlO6 arises from differences in their chemical composition, bonding, and crystal structure. EuGePd2, with metallic bonding, involves transition metals Ge and Pd, contributing to a higher formation energy due to less stable bonds. Eu2TaAlO6, a complex oxide, benefits from strong ionic/covalent bonds and energy stability from lattice structure, involving Eu, transition metal Ta, and electronegative O.


Based on the above information, write a reflection on your previous suggestion, explaining how successful it was, the reasons for its success or failure, and what will be needed to further achieve the target property.
Based on the reflection, propose a new material composition to better achieve the desired property, providing a reason to justify your choice.
If previous suggestions are not successful enough, you may need to consider other material systems.

Your final answer must be given as a Python dictionary in the following format:
{"reflection": $REFLECTION, "reason": $REASON, "composition": $COMPOSITION}
Here are some requirements:
$REFLECTION should be a string of 300 characters or less.
$REASON should be a string of 300 characters or less.
$COMPOSITION should be composed only of element symbols and digits, and should not include decimal numbers or symbols such as '-', '', '.', '{', '}', etc.


# Next guess:
{'reflection': 'LaEuPd6 was not successful; formation energy was too high at -0.866 eV/atom. Substitution patterns indicate that complex oxides with strong covalent and ionic bonds are more promising for lower energy states.', 'reason': "Introducing Eu2TaAlO6's bonding in a composition like Eu2TcAlO6 may leverage similar properties, achieving more negative formation energy.", 'composition': 'Eu2TcAlO6'}
